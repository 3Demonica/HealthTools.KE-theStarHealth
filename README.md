# HealthTools.KE - theStar Health

HealthTools is a suite of data-driven web and SMS-based tools that help citizens check everything from medicine prices and hospital services, to whether their doctor is a quack or not. The toolkit was pioneered in Kenya, and has since also been deployed in Ghana, Nigeria, and South Africa. The original project can be accessed at: http://health.the-star.co.ke
